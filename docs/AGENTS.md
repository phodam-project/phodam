When creating documentation, use the following rules:
1. Be succint. Do not be overly verbose.
2. Show only one example of each piece of functionality.
3. Provide a reason as to why you would want to use this functionality.
4. Avoid using emojis.
5. Write in a professional manner as if this were for enterprise users.
6. Create a brief, but useful, summary at the end.
7. Use named parameters in function calls if there is more than one parameter.
